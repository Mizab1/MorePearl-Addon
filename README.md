# **More Pearl**
Sick of using normal Ender Pearls for the same old teleport? Take your gameplay to the next level with the More Pearls Addon, a set of high-powered utility pearls that will give you the tactical edge you need to control combat, movement, and crowd management.
Each pearl has a special ability that will trigger when it hits the ground, giving you the power to control enemies, escape danger, and manipulate the battlefield in a variety of ways.

### **Type of Pearls:**
- Slowness Pearl: When this pearl hits the ground, it will apply a powerful Slowness effect to all entities within a radius. Great for crowd control or slowing down fast-moving targets in their tracks.
- Blindness Pearl: When this pearl hits the ground, it will burst with a dark cloud that applies a Blindness effect to all entities within a radius for a short period of time. Great for blinding enemies, escaping from dangerous situations, or ambushing unsuspecting foes.
- Swap Ender Pearl: This pearl will swap the location of the player who throws it with that of a nearby entity at the point where it lands. Extremely useful for quick escapes, repositioning during combat, or ambushing enemies when they least expect it.
- Target Pearl: Strike a target on an entity to designate it as your target, and then throw the pearl. Instead of teleporting as usual, the targeted entity will teleport to the landing spot of the pearl. Great for separating enemies, pulling threats away, or mob positioning.
- Vortex Pearl: When this pearl lands, it generates a strong vortex that attracts nearby entities towards its center. Great for gathering mobs together, managing battlefield positioning, or area attacks.
